# kaggle-recipes
Working on recipes challenge from [kaggle what's cooking challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/manuelatadvice/whats-cooking/). 

Started quite late, was away for most of the time and had to deal with a broken computer halfway through. 

Played around with ngrams to analyse ingredient strings and filter away noisy ones

i.e. turn _ground black pepper_ into (_ground black_, _black pepper_)

Such a string will contribute to _black pepper_'s seen elsewhere and allow to estimate ingredients accurately.
